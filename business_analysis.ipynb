    "2. Plot different scenarios, each with its probability on a line plot where one can see how does the capital evolves over time i.e. capital vs. iterations for each random sample of a binominal process.\n",
    "3. Obtain a single parameter that indicates whether a business is feasible in this sense or not. Defining feasibility as having an X percent of the mass of the curve in 1. in positive territory. After how many iterations? 5? 10? Infinite?\n",
    "4. Find out how likely it is to go bankrupt when one has a capital X. This could be at any period of time since the events are independent. Plot this probability of bankruptcy vs. the amount of capital.\n"
